HTTP1 VS HTTP2:

1. HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.
2. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection,
3. while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. 
4. HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.
